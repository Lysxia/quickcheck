-- | Unsafe combinators for the 'Gen' monad.
--
-- 'Gen' is only morally a monad: two generators that are supposed
-- to be equal will give the same probability distribution, but they
-- might be different as functions from random number seeds to values.
-- QuickCheck maintains the illusion that a 'Gen' is a probability
-- distribution and does not allow you to distinguish two generators
-- that have the same distribution.
--
-- The functions in this module allow you to break this illusion by
-- reusing the same random number seed twice. This is unsafe because
-- by applying the same seed to two morally equal generators, you can
-- see whether they are really equal or not.
